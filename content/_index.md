description: "Hi there, and welcome! I am a researcher and instructor in psychology and statistics. I studied psychology at Université Grenoble Alpes and this is where I learnt how to **use numbers to better understand human behavior**. When I am not coding or teaching, I’m usually enjoying the amazing outdoors which we have in the Alps, be it by biking, climbing, or hiking."
