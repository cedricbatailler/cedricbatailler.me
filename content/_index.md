subtitle: "Behavioral scientist"

description: "Hi there, and welcome! I am a behavioral research scientist and an instructor spcialized in psychology and statistics. I studied psychology at Université Grenoble Alpes and this is where I learnt how to use numbers (or so-called data science methods) to better understand human behavior. Right now, I am looking for new ways to put these skills at use. When I am not coding or teaching, I’m usually enjoying the amazing outdoors which we have in the Alps, be it by biking, climbing, or hiking."
